# Welcome
Welcome to my blog! I'm Stan Janssen, a software engineer from The Netherlands with a passion for all things programming, knowledge sharing and board games.

For a long time I have wanted to start a blog, but never made the time for it. One of my goals for 2020 was to write a post for the [F# Advent Calendar](https://sergeytihon.com/2020/10/22/f-advent-calendar-in-english-2020/). So here we are, with just over four weeks to go, it was time to start this blog! On the 13th of December you can expect a post on here about writing an application with plugins in F#.

However, on this blog, you will not only find posts about both functional programming, but also about object oriented programming (C#/JavaScript mostly), developing for the cloud and my experience with learning a new programming language like Prolog.
